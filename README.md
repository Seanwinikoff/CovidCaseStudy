# Covid Case Study
Over the past two years, Corona virus has been THE trending topic in most of our daily discourse. With millions dead around the world and potentially no end in sight, all we can do is focus on past data to understand how we let things reach this point.

This study looks at total cases and deaths using a public dataset (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). I aimed to uncover the likelihood of dying if you contracted covid depending on your country as well as looking at countries with highest infection rates compared to population.

Includes: SQL queries, cleaned excel data, raw data from public dataset
